CamelCase has a time complexity of $O(n)$ because it has a single loop that iterates every character in the string once, doing constant work (checking the current char) each step.
The space complexity for CamelCase is also $O(n)$ because it has an input complexity of $O(n)$ and an auxiliary complexity of $O(1)$.
\
Correctness and the Loop Invariant has a worst case time complexity of $O(n^2)$ and a best case time complexity of $O(n)$ because it iterates over every element in the input array, iterating backwards at each step as it sorts the array.
It has an input space complexity of $O(n)$ and an auxiliary space complexity of  $O(1)$.
