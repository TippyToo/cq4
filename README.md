CamelCase has a time complexity of $O(n)$ because it has a single loop that iterates every character in the string once, doing constant work (checking the current char) each step.
The space complexity for CamelCase is also $O(n)$ because it has an input complexity of $O(n)$ and an auxiliary complexity of $O(1)$.
